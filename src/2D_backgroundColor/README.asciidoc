== 2D Background Color
:toc:
:!numbered:

The background color in OpenGL is part of the state (the OpenGL Context). It is set with the function https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glClearColor.xhtml[`glClearColor`] and applied with the function https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/html/glClear.xhtml[`glClear`].

In this example, these functions are used in the `preRender` function

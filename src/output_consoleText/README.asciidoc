== Output Console Text
:toc:
:!numbered:

Console output is outside the scope of OpenGL, so we can do it any way we choose. SDL doesn't have any direct support for console output, so we can just do it ourselves in plain C++.

In this example, we're using a global variable (`frameLine`) to store a string, that we can add content to. Each frame we write out that string to the console (in `postRender`).

We can add information to `frameLine`, such as the frameCount, or the frameTime.

This example overwrites previous content on the same line. This is achieved though not writing and end line, and reseting to the start of each line with `\r`.

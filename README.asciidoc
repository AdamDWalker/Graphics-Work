This is the source for the in-progress book *graphicsByExample*. It is hosted online at http://shearer12345.github.io/graphicsByExample

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. :-)

The open nature of this book is partially inspired by Robert Nystrom's excellent http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/[Game Programming Patterns]

## Example code

* each example is complete and in a separate git branch
  ** allowing you to `diff` between branches to see what has changed
* the `master` branch composes all the example branches together for rapid demonstrations/explorations
* all examples are in C++11, using modern OpenGL
* all examples are cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OS X)

## Getting example code

* clone the repository recursively (to also pull down the dependencies)

[source, bash]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shearer12345/graphicsByExample.git
----

## Building examples

* we use https://premake.github.io/index.html[premake5] to build solutions and projects
  ** Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015
  ** Make
  ** Xcode4
  ** MonoDevelop

* to build, in the root of the repository, run:

### Build the solution/make files

Initially, and whenever you change the branch, or the `premake5.lua` file, (re)run *premake*

.Linux, OS X
[source, bash]
----
./premake5 $ACTION # <1>
----

.Windows
[source, bat]
----
./premake.bat %ACTION% # <1>
----
<1> replace `ACTION` with the tool you wish to use

### Build your project

#### Visual Studio

1. Load the `.sln` file
2. Build and run the project you wish to explore


#### Make

[source, bash]
----
make
./bin/$EXAMPLE # <1>
----
<1> replace `EXAMPLE` with the example you wish to run
